	30% Luminus online quizzes (best 8 of 10)<br>
	60% Project<br>

	DSA student here. This was a chill mod for me because the stuff they teach in this mod are either already taught in high school or really intuitive. The course briefly covers topics such as the design of studies, association, sampling, observational studies, and laws of probability. Each week we have to watch about 30 minutes of pre-recorded lecture, then do an online quiz of 10 questions. Tutorial sessions are once every two weeks. Each session is 90 minutes long. There are 25 students in a session, and they are split into five groups of five. The tutor is a nice guy.

	<h3>10% Tutorial*5</h3>
	Before each tutorial session, we need to complete a worksheet individually. They take about 1 hour to do. During the sessions, we would have time to discuss and then share our answers with the class. If you watch all the lecture videos, you should be able to finish the worksheets in no time. After that, we can ask the tutor questions regarding the content of the lecture videos, or literally anything else. Like, one time, a student asked for advice for freshmen, and the tutor gave a really sophisticated reply. Even though you can leave right after the discussion of the worksheets, most of us stayed connected until there are no more questions. 

	<h3>30% Luminus online quizzes</h3> 
	Each week we have to do a quiz with ten MCQs on Luminus. Some of them are tricky, so you might want to check your group mates’ answers before submitting them. The worst two quizzes are omitted in the calculation of the grade. According to my tutor, it is common for a student to get all 30%, so there is no stress.

	<h3>60% Project</h3>
	The group project is the biggest deal of this module. It is not an exaggeration to say that the project is the sole deciding factor of your final grade because almost everyone gets full or nearly full marks on the rest 40%. The project consists of two parts. In Part A, we have to choose one of the six research papers and apply what we learned quantitatively to analyze the findings. Then, we have to give a presentation of about 15 minutes in the last tutorial section. Part B is just some calculations done in excel. The hardest part of the project is to find a time that all five of us are available. Thankfully, all my teammates are super cooperative.
	<br>
	In conclusion, teamwork is critical for this module. You definitely don’t want to let your group mates down because there is a peer evaluation form at the end of the semester.
