    <h1>MA1102R Module Review</h1>
	Taken in 20/21 Sem 1 (remote learning)<br>
	Lecturer: Prof. Wang Fei<br>
	Textbook: Thomas’ Calculus 14th Ed.<br>
	Workload: medium-high (7 hrs/week)<br>
	Expected Grade: A-<br>
	Actual Grade: A-<br>

	<h2>Assessment:</h2>
	5% Sagemath Quiz<br>
	15% Homework*10<br>
	40% Tests*2<br>
	40% Final<br>
	<br>

	Oh no, it's calculus again. I have already dealt with it at least three times before I took this mod. None of them ended up stuck with me. Prof. Wang did a great job explaining the mathematical concepts rigorously, but I guess my brain just wasn't built for mathematics this pure. All lectures are pre-recorded on Luminus, you can watch them any time you like. I took this OTOT feature to my advantage and skipped 90% of the videos after the integral sign appeared. That strategy definitely didn't help my final at all. There are also tutorial worksheets, extra problem sets, and consultation time slots, but I didn’t bother to use any of them. 

	<h3>5% Sagemath Quiz</h3>
	This is a weird quiz. We can only use a software called Sagemath to do 8 computational problems. It is open book, so we have access to all commands. Some answers can be as long as 17 digits. I got full marks on this one without much effort.

	<h3>15% Homework*10</h3>
	Each assignment takes approximately two hours to complete. The questions are similar to those in the tutorials, though they do get harder over time. I usually don’t check my answers with other classmates because the weight is almost negligible. Because I decided to skip the lecture videos after test 2, doing homework is the only way I can tell how bad I’m going to fail my final.

	<h3>40% Tests*2</h3>
	As you can see, each test is half as important as the final. They are openbook, but you certainly won’t have time to search through the textbook for that single theorem that you have only seen once in your entire life. For some reason, I scored higher than average in both tests. 

	<h3>40% Final</h3>
	I like to think of taking the finals as playing in escape rooms. Some escape rooms are fun, others are challenging, but this one is pure scary. It is literally a collection of the hardest problem of each concept. There are simply no easy marks. At the one hour mark, I had only done 40% of the problems. After another hour, I wrote down 15% more. Of course, later I found some mistakes in some of my solutions, so my final score would be ~45/100. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In conclusion, please be mentally and physically prepared if you are planning on taking this mod. I’d say that my relationship with calculus was quite nice compared to others. I’ve read other reviews that some students actually cry during the finals. I didn’t cry, I was just mildly infuriated at that time. So long, calculus, hope I can understand you better next time we meet.
