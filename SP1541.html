	I’m an international student, and luckily I got band 3 for my QET. Just when I thought that I’m done with English classes my entire life, I was hit with the fact that all science students have to take this mod in order to meet graduation requirements. Ok, if everyone has to take this, then it's probably like those easy GE mods, right? To my disappointment, the exact opposite is true. This has to be the most stressful mod I took the previous semester. In fact, I have made up my mind that I will S/U by week 6. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Even before the semester started, we were told to write a popular news article based on one of the five research articles given in the instructions. I have never done anything like that, so I spent a lot of time on that pre-course writing. Classes began on week 2, and there are two sessions of two hours each. There are 16 people in my class, it wasn’t that hard to get to know all of them. Unlike the classes in other mods, this one required full attention and concentration. You definitely don’t want to miss the discussion, or fail to answer what she said when the teacher calls my name.
	</p>
	<p>
	During the first half of the semester, we have to read a chapter of a popular science book, and a news article. The five chapters are related to biology, maths, physics, chemistry, and statistics. English is not my first language, so it usually takes two hours for me to read each book chapter. Then in each session, we were split into four groups of four to complete a worksheet on Google docs that asks certain questions about the assigned book chapter or news article. I’m also a slow typer (~50 wpm), so given the time limit, my answer is the shortest every time. Besides the worksheet, the teacher introduced several moves and strategies to make science more engaging for the general audience. They are all really helpful for future assignments, so be sure to take notes!
	</p>
	<p>
	After reading all five book chapters, we had to write a <b>Book Chapter Reflection (5%)</b>. Basically, we pick one book chapter and write what is good and bad about it. It wasn’t a big assignment, but I still procrastinated until five hours before the submission deadline. Warning: If you are a master procrastinator like me, this mod will be a nightmare. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Things moved rather smoothly to the second half of the semester. Right after the recess week, the teacher reminded us to submit <b>Popular science news article 1 (20%)</b> by the end of week 7. Instructions are similar to the pre course one, the only difference is this time, we have to choose the research article on our own. Of course I did not forget about it. In fact, I remembered it too well. I spend way too much time on finding the perfect research paper, one that is not too easy, nor too hard; not too old, nor too recent; not too interesting (then there will already be plenty of news article on it), nor too boring (then it will be hard to make connections to real life). After wasting all of recess week on reading research articles, I finally settled down on one of them, just four days before the deadline. Once again, I submitted on the last day. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Then, the teacher told us to get ready for the <b>Popular science news article 2 (30%)</b>, and the <b>Oral Presentation (25%)</b> on one of my news articles, which were both due in week 11. I got sort of scared when she mentioned that there is going to be an oral presentation, but relieved when she said that it will be pre recorded on our computers. That means we can type out every single word that we’re going to say, then cut the script into pieces and stick them around the front camera. This way, I can read out the script and maintain eye contact at the same time. I thought it was going to be a breeze. Also, there are individual conference sessions from week 9 to 11. In those 20 minutes, you can ask questions to the teacher regarding her feedback for the Popular science news article 1, which is super beneficial. In class, we discussed tips and tricks to improve public speaking skills, something which I don’t have and hope I won’t ever use in the future. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Unlike last time, I quickly decided which article I’m using and to my surprise, submitted two days before the deadline. Life pro tip: you can ask your classmates to peer review your writing. It is always better to have an extra pair of eyes to spot mistakes. I also submitted the <b>Reflective commentary 2 (5%)</b> on the same day. It is a small paragraph about what deliberate decisions I made in the writing of the news article to make it more like “popular news.” I was so proud of myself that day becaused 35% of my grade was settled that day.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, I utterly underestimated the time it required to record my presentation. First, you have to write a word for word script. Then, you have to make an engaging presentation filled with fancy animations. It was due on Wednesday noon, and I hadn’t even finished the slides on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, I woke up at 6 to record. I split my presentation into ten scenes, and each scene took five to ten takes to perfect. After putting all parts together, I found out that my video length was under the lower limit! So I added a short sketch that is not funny at all and stitched it to the beginning to meet the eight minute mark. To this day, I still wondered if it helped my score or rather, made it lower. Finally, I submitted at 1030… to the wrong folder. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I would like to say this module made me experience time in a way that I have never felt before. Four weeks used to feel like a long time, but when a SP1541 assignment is due four weeks from now, it’s already too late to start. This mod was the source of over half of my academic stress this semester, but this is definitely not the teacher’s fault. This mod taught me to manage my time better, and I also made some friends. Now I’m just glad that it is over.
