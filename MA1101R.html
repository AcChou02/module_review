	I enjoyed this module throughout the whole semester. Prof. Tan’s web lectures were super entertaining and relaxing. This module taught topics like linear systems, matrices, vector spaces, orthogonality, diagonalization, and linear transformations. The subjects were introduced one by one, in a very detailed manner. When I watch his 2~3 hour weekly web lectures, I feel like I was not “learning” many new things. But at the end of each week, I will always be surprised about how many new skills I have acquired and how they relate to everything I have learned so far. You’ll definitely fall in love with “The map of linear algebra.” Together with a few other theorems, you can solve almost all problems in every practice session.
	There are also live lectures on zoom every week, though attendance is optional. During the live lectures, you can ask question 

	<h3>15% Luminus online quizzes (best 10 of 12)</h3>
	By the Sunday of each week, we have to complete a quiz to check our understanding. They do not make up a big part of the final grade, so you shouldn’t spend too much time checking answers with multiple classmates. If you don’t finish the quiz by 1600 on Sunday, you will receive a thoughtful reminder from your TA. Luckily, my best ten quizzes are all full marks, and this is also quite common. 

	<h3>15% Practice*4</h3>
	This is where things get interesting. We all get one hour to rush through a worksheet. In the hour, we can use MATLAB, communicate with friends, use google search. Basically, there are no restrictions. But by the end of the hour, we all have to submit our solutions. My practice sessions are 1700~1800, so I’m super tired every time. In my last practice session, I accidentally submitted the original worksheet instead of my answer file!!! I only found out about that after the results of the practice are released. After a few late-night emails, I was forgiven and was only punished by deducting 10% of my score on that practice. Thank you, Prof. Tan!

	<h3>20% Homework*2</h3>
	The homework problems are way more challenging and exciting than those in quizzes, practices, or even the final exam, probably because it is not timed. We were given about two to three weeks to work on ten to twelve problems with parts. In contrast to practices, we have to do them independently, and we can check our answers with friends later. About a little fewer than half of homework problems are proving problems, and they are graded by attempt rather than correctness. In other words, you can get points just by giving the problem a decent shot. As a result, two-thirds of students score 90+ on each homework. 

	<h3>50% Final</h3>
	The final was 2 hours long, and it had 5 problems with parts. Only a quarter of the problems required some proving, while the rest were purely computational. MATLAB can be used to find RREF and stuff, so it was helpful. However, the problems were way harder than past years’ finals. It might be because of the remote learning, though I’m not sure how harder problems are supposed to prevent cheating.

	Anyway, great mod. It gave me a totally different perspective of numbers and matrices. Also, someone in the live lecture mentioned that Prof. Tan looks like Blathers from Animal Crossing (the owl). We all had a great laugh and I couldn’t unsee it from then on.
