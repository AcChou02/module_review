    <h1>DSA1101 Module Review</h1>
	Taken in 20/21 Sem 1 (remote learning)<br>
	Lecturer: Prof. Sun Baoluo<br>
	Textbook: None<br>
	Workload: low (4 hrs/week)<br>
	Expected Grade: A<br>
	Actual Grade: A<br>

	<h2>Assessment:</h2>
	10% Examplify Quizzes*3<br>
	40% Midterm<br>
	50% Final<br>
	<br>
	Overall, this is an easy mod. There are just four hours of lecture and one hour of tutorial per week, both recorded on Zoom and can be viewed later in the semester. I usually watch recorded lectures at 2x speed because the professor speaks relatively slow. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods are covered in the lectures. We learned about K nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, k means, the apriori algorithm, and linear and logistic regression. On top of all that, we wrote R code to do the calculations. 
	One thing I particularly like about this module is how active the forum is. Throughout the semester, Prof. Sun encouraged all of us to contribute to the class forum. The discussions are mainly about extra R code written by some helpful classmates. By the end of the semester, there are ~40 threads. Even though forum contribution doesn’t count towards the final grade, we still had a lot of fun replying to the threads. 

	<h3>10% Examplify Quizzes*3</h3>
	Because of remote learning, all quizzes are conducted online via Examplify. All of them consist of only multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. No wifi, no backward navigation, and can access R or any file in the computer.
	<ul>
		<li>
		Quiz 1 on week 5, 10 questions in 15 minutes, 2.5% of the final grade.
		</li>
		<li>
		Quiz 2 on week 9, 10 questions in 15 minutes, 2.5% of the final grade.
		</li>
		<li>
		Quiz 3 on week 11, 15 questions in 20 minutes, 5% of the final grade.
		</li>
	</ul>
	The last quiz was significantly more challenging than the previous two quizzes because of the large amount of calculation involved. 

	<h3>40% Midterm</h3>
	The midterm was on week 7. The rules were pretty similar to the quizzes, except it was very long (40 questions in 60 minutes). Also, the order of questions was random, so luck plays a significant role in this. Thankfully, this was my only module with a midterm this sem. And with a bit of preparation, I was able to get full marks. The average was 37 out of 40.

	<h3>50% Final</h3>
	In contrast to the midterm, the final was way more mentally and physically draining. We had to complete 60 questions in 90 minutes. I didn’t prepare for this final because I need to study for MA1102R. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In conclusion, Prof. Sun did a great job introducing the basics of data science to us.
